All the levels are in the `src` directory. Open them with VS Code.

# The tutorial level

Level 0: The tutorial level, is at `src/complex/basic.lean`. All solutions are given. Read through this code first, and refer back to it if necessary. 

In the tutorial level we define `0`, `1`, `+`, `-` and `*`, and prove that the complex numbers are a ring.

Note: you can play the tutorial level if you are online, even if you haven't installed Lean, because you can play in the Lean Web Editor. Click [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FImperialCollegeLondon%2Fcomplex-number-game%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fcomplex%2Fbasic.lean) to interact with the tutorial level. Note that to play the main levels, you will have to install Lean. 

# The main levels

Anyone who has played Majora's Mask knows that all good games have 4 levels.

People who know some basic Lean tactics should be able to have a go at these. Open the relevant project files in VS Code and
fill in all the `sorry`s.

* Level 1: sqrt(-1), is at `src/complex/I.lean`

* Level 2: Complex conjugation, is at `src/complex/conj.lean`

* Level 3: the complex norm (squared), is at `src/complex/norm_sq.lean`

* Level 4: the coercion from the reals to the complexes, is at `src/complex/of_real.lean`

# Challenges

These are harder, and I give fewer hints.

* Level 5: the complex numbers are a field, is at `src/complex/field.lean`

* Level 6: the complex numbers are an algebraically closed field, is at `src/complex/alg_closed.lean`
