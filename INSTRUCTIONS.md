All the levels are in the `src` directory. Open them with VS Code

# The tutorial level

Level 0: The tutorial level, is at `src/complex/basic.lean`. All solutions are given. Read through this code first, and refer back to it if necessary. 

In the tutorial level we define `0`, `1`, `+`, `-` and `*`, and prove that the complex numbers are a ring.

# The normal levels

People who know some basic Lean tactics should be able to have a go at these. Open the relevant project files in VS Code and
fill in all the `sorry`s.

* Level 1: sqrt(-1), is at `src/complex/I.lean`

* Level 2: Complex conjugation, is at `src/complex/conj.lean`

* Level 3: the complex norm (squared), is at `src/complex/norm_sq.lean`

* Level 4: the coercion from the reals to the complexes, is at `src/complex/of_real.lean`

# Challenges

These are harder, and I give fewer hints.

* Level 5: the complex numbers are a field

* Level 6: the complex numbers are an algebraically closed field.
