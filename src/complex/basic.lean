# The complex numbers

We define the complex numbers, and prove that they are a ring.
We then might do other stuff

# main definitions:

zero
one
add

The complex numbers.
A documented remix of part of mathlib

Our goal is to define the complex numbers, and then "extract some API".
Our first goal is to define addition and multiplication,
and prove that the complex numbers are a commutative ring.
We then do a slightly more computer-sciency worked development of the
natural inclusion from the reals to the complexes. 

There are then a bunch of exercises, which can be solved in term mode
or tactic mode. . 
a lot of stuff we don't need for this one precise result. As an appendix
We leave as exercises
the API extraction for the stuff we skipped, namely the following
complex conjugation and the norm function.
